# MVM ADAPT project

The MVM-Adapt project, wth the italian title: 
*Milano Ventilatore Meccanico Adattativo in presenza d'incertezza*
is a research project [funded](https://www.mur.gov.it/sites/default/files/2021-05/TABELLA%20B_%20PE_all%20DD%201049_Progetti%20finanziabili%20Bando%20FISR%202020.pdf) by the Italin Ministry of Research and University under the program FISR 2020 COVID.

MVM-Adapt aims at increasing operability and robustness of the MVM by exploiting the paradigm of
Self Adaptive Software. The new MVM control software will be able to monitor its operation and
uncertain environmental conditions (e.g., the health status of patients), and to adapt its operation
according to precise safety and health requirements of the patient. 

It builds on the existing MVM project (https://mvm.care) which had the goal to minimize the time and the costs required to get a
lung ventilator designed, certified, manufactured, and distributed during the COVID emergency [see](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0044445).
