The project is aimed at developing technologies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases, with the goal of having a short-term impact on patients belonging to well-defined reference communities.

In particular, the project aims to create digital devices and tools for data collection in support of personalized and proximity medicine solutions; develop remote monitoring and treatment tools; evaluate the importance and impact of environmental factors and lifestyle in the development of chronic pathologies in fragile populations; implement oncological therapy methods for tumors that cannot be treated with conventional approaches.

UniBg is the leader of Spoke 1 dedicated to the development of data-driven diagnostic and therapy methods based on artificial intelligence technologies.
